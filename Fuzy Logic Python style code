# This code presents a fuzzy logic algorithm written in python style code for the remote id, rf selection for a drone:

#Abstract View for our Mathematical Model in steps:
#In the first 100 meters for flight from the remote control we transmit through bluetooth and wifi. 
#After the 100 meters initial flight and away from the remote control we transmit constantly with ads-b out and we receive from ads-b in.
#After the 100 meters initial flight and away from the remote control we transmit through, bluetooth, wifi, 4g/5g, and/or IoT, and/or satellite according to availability and energy battery efficiency. This RF communication call through 4G/5G, IoT and satellite is made to the local Aviation Authority and /or IoT devices to airplanes and other devices or other available objects. This decision comes from a fuzzy logic model made algorithm. 


PseudoCode Model:
float wifi;
float bluetooth_transmit;
bool bluetooth_available;
bluetooth_transmit
float IoT;
float ADS_B_transmit;
float 4G;
float 5G;
float SatCom;
float range_from_rc;
bool wifi_available;
while flight = true:
	if range_from_rc < 100:
		wifi_transmit and bluetooth_transmit is true
	elsif range_from_rc > 100:
	ads_b_transmit = true;
		if (wifi_available == true or bluetooth_available == true):
			if wifi_available == true:
				wifi_transmit = true;
			else bluetooth_transmit = true;
		elsif 4g_available == true:
			4g_transmit = true;
		elsif 5g_available == true:
			5g_transmit = true;
		elsif iot_available == true:
			iot_transmit = true;	
		else sat_transmit =  true;
In case of battery consumption emergency the following code can be applied:
while flight = true:
	if range_from_rc < 100:
		wifi_transmit and bluetooth_transmit is true
	elsif range_from_rc > 100:
	ads_b_transmit = true;
if energy_emergency = true:
			if (wifi_available == true or bluetooth_available == true):
			if wifi_available == true:
				wifi_transmit = true;
			else bluetooth_transmit = true;
			
			elsif iot_available == true:
				iot_transmit = true;
			
			elsif 4g_available == true:
			4g_transmit = true;
			elsif 5g_available == true:
			5g_transmit = true:
			else sat_transmit =  true;
